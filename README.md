# Resume_Checker
loads a word doc (docx) resume and analyzes the resume to show your skills

### INTRO & Backgroun
A friend of mine was recently looking for work and we were discussing resumes, specifically his. After our conversation I started to wonder does your resume really convey what you think it does about you.  During an less than interesting meeting I wrote this simple app to take in a word document (DOCX) resume and then perfom some basic text analytics on the document to determine if the resume matched what was trying to be conveyed.
